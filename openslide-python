### Notes for openslide python installed on Centos7 Server
(1) refer to the weblink: https://www.pythonf.cn/read/108919
Step 1: install compatible openslide: 
# yum install openslide # see here: https://openslide.org/download/
Step 2: create virtual environment in Anaconda (for version controls):
# conda create n challenge python=3.6 # NOTE THAT: openslide is working well on python 3.6, but it has bugs on python 3.8 versions, 
                                        in my testing, it reports 'OSError: /root/anaconda3/bin/../lib/libgobject-2.0.so.0: undefined symbol: g_uri_ref'
# activate challenge
# pip install openslide-python      # install Python interface to the OpenSlide library, refer to: https://pypi.org/project/openslide-python/
