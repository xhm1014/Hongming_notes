### Notes for openslide python installed on Centos7 Server???????
(1) refer to the weblink: https://www.pythonf.cn/read/108919
Step 1: install compatible openslide: 
# yum install openslide # see here: https://openslide.org/download/
Step 2: create virtual environment in Anaconda (for version controls):
# conda create n challenge python=3.6 # NOTE THAT: openslide is working well on python 3.6, but it has bugs on python 3.8 versions, 
                                        in my testing, it reports 'OSError: /root/anaconda3/bin/../lib/libgobject-2.0.so.0: undefined symbol: g_uri_ref'
# activate challenge
# pip install openslide-python      # install Python interface to the OpenSlide library, refer to: https://pypi.org/project/openslide-python/

### Notes for Pytorch installation on my Linux Server??????
# in my testing, when pytorch version installed is not compatible with the GPU, the data loading to GPU is extremely slow!!!!!!!!
(1) In my server, I used RTX3090 GPU, my installed cuda version is: cuda 11.1 # refer to the weblink: https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/279401802 
(2) In my server, I installed this version in the challenge conda environment: see pytorch weblink: https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/
## CUDA 11.0

# conda install pytorch==1.7.1 torchvision==0.8.2 torchaudio==0.7.2 cudatoolkit=11.0 -c pytorch

## the speed for installation is very slow, for solutions, please see the link: https://blog.csdn.net/watermelon1123/article/details/88122020
