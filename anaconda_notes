I installed anoconda in win10 into the default directories, but later i cannot find the directory where i installed in the computer.

The following is the directory for my anaconda: C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3

The following are problems I addressed:

1) when clicking the Conda in the web browser, it reports the error: 
Error Message:
EnvironmentLocationNotFound: Not a conda environment

my solution: follow this webpage: https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/nb_conda/issues/66
             go to the directory: C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\nb_conda
             open envmanager.py file: 
             Replace for env in info['envs']] with for env in info['envs'] if env != info['root_prefix']] in nb_conda/envmanager.py.
             
2) when click runing some code, error message: the ordinal 191 could not be lcoated in the dynamic link library
                                               C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Library\bin\mkl_intel_thread.dll

My tempory solution: open Anaconda Prompt, then type: set CONDA_DLL_SEARCH_MODIFICATION_ENABLE=1
                     then type: juypter notebook -> to open jupyter in browser
                     
                     
3) errors: no modules named tensorlow

My temporary solution: run Anaconda Prompt as the adminitrator, then install tensorflow as:conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow
                      then reopen jupyter notebook
                      
4) jupyter notebook debugger:
my temporary solution: from IPython.core.debugger import Tracer
               then: at the break point locaton: %debug (or Tracer()())# trigger pdb debuger
               finally: quit # quit debugger
               
my second soluton: 1) add following code to trigger pdb debugger: import pdb
                                                                  pdb.set_trace()
                      click view -> Toggle Line Numbers # to have line numbers
                      ctrl+enter to run program
                                                                  b * (* represent a break line number) # to debug
