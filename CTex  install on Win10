after installation, when I opened the winedt, the 'dvipdf' button is gray and cannot be used. to solve this problem, right click the .tex file and open it with Texworks, then first
execute it with Texworks, after that open it with winedt, now the 'dvipdf' button is working

(2) how to register the winedt for free use??
